  This course provides a comprehensive treatment of the theory, design, and implementation of digital signal processing algorithms. In the first half of the course, we emphasize frequency-domain and Z-transform analysis. In the second half of the course, we investigate advanced topics in signal processing, including multirate signal processing, filter design, adaptive filtering, quantizer design, and power spectrum estimation. The course is fairly application-independent, to provide a strong theoretical foundation for future study in communications, control, or image processing.

* **Deep Learning Specialization, Prof. Andrew Ng, Kian Katanforoosh**  
[[Course]](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

  In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.

  MIT's introductory course on deep learning methods with applications to computer vision, natural language processing, biology, and more! Students will gain foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms and get practical experience in building neural networks in TensorFlow. Course concludes with a project proposal competition with feedback from staff and panel of industry sponsors. Prerequisites assume calculus (i.e. taking derivatives) and linear algebra (i.e. matrix multiplication), we'll try to explain everything else along the way! Experience in Python is helpful but not necessary.

  Computer Graphics (ECS175) teaches the basic principles of 3-dimensional computer graphics. The focus will be the elementary mathematics techniques for positioning objects in three dimensional space, the geometric optics necessary to determine how light bounces off surfaces, and the ways to utilize a computer system and methods to implement the algorithms and techniques necessary to produce basic 3-dimensional illustrations. Detailed topics will include the following: transformational geometry, positioning of virtual cameras and light sources, hierarchical modeling of complex objects, rendering of complex models, shading algorithms, and methods for rendering and shading curved objects.

  This course aims to give an overview of basic and state-of-the-art methods of rendering. Offline methods such as ray and path tracing, photon mapping and many other algorithms are introduced and various refinement are explained. The basics of the involved physics, such as geometric optics, surface and media interaction with light and camera models are outlined. The apparatus of Monte Carlo methods is introduced which is heavily used in several algorithms and its refinement in the form of stratified sampling and the Metropolis-Hastings method is explained.
