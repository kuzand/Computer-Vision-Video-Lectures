## Signal Processing

* **Signals and Systems 6.003 (MIT), Prof. Dennis Freeman**  
[[Course website]](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-003-signals-and-systems-fall-2011/lecture-videos/)

  Signals and Systems 6.003 covers the fundamentals of signal and system analysis, focusing on representations of discrete-time and continuous-time signals (singularity functions, complex exponentials and geometrics, Fourier representations, Laplace and Z transforms, sampling) and representations of linear, time-invariant systems (difference and differential equations, block diagrams, system functions, poles and zeros, convolution, impulse and step responses, frequency responses). Applications are drawn broadly from engineering and physics, including feedback and control, communications, and signal processing.
    

* **Digital Signal Processing ECSE-4530 (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), Richard Radke**

  This course provides a comprehensive treatment of the theory, design, and implementation of digital signal processing algorithms. In the first half of the course, we emphasize frequency-domain and Z-transform analysis. In the second half of the course, we investigate advanced topics in signal processing, including multirate signal processing, filter design, adaptive filtering, quantizer design, and power spectrum estimation. The course is fairly application-independent, to provide a strong theoretical foundation for future study in communications, control, or image processing. This course was originally offered at the graduate level but retooled in 2009 to be senior-level.

[[Course website]](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dsp)

  In this series of four courses, you will learn the fundamentals of Digital Signal Processing from the ground up. Starting from the basic definition of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice.

We will look at the vast world of digital imaging, from how computers and digital cameras form images to how digital special effects are used in Hollywood movies to how the Mars Rover was able to send photographs across millions of miles of space.

  The course starts by looking at how the human visual system works and then teaches you about the engineering, mathematics, and computer science that makes digital images work. You will learn the basic algorithms used for adjusting images, explore JPEG and MPEG standards for encoding and compressing video images, and go on to learn about image segmentation, noise removal and filtering. Finally, we will end with image processing techniques used in medicine.

  Variational Methods are among the most classical techniques for optimization of cost functions in higher dimension. Many challenges in Computer Vision and in other domains of research can be formulated as variational methods. Examples include denoising, deblurring, image segmentation, tracking, optical flow estimation, depth estimation from stereo images or 3D reconstruction from multiple views.

  In this class, I will introduce the basic concepts of variational methods, the Euler-Lagrange calculus and partial differential equations. I will discuss how respective computer vision and image analysis challenges can be cast as variational problems and how they can be efficiently solved. Towards the end of the class, I will discuss convex formulations and convex relaxations which allow to compute optimal or near-optimal solutions in the variational setting.

The goal is to reconstruct the three-dimensional world and the camera motion from multiple images. To this end, one determines correspondences between points in various images and respective constraints that allow to compute motion and 3D structure. A particular emphasis of the lecture is on mathematical descriptions of rigid body motion and of perspective projection. For estimating camera motion and 3D geometry we will make use of both spectral methods and methods of nonlinear optimization.

Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). We will focus on teaching how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g. backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks and guide the students through hands-on assignments and a final course project. Much of the background and materials of this course will be drawn from the ImageNet Challenge.
